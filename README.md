    * Or here: https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1
* Install Node.js v10.2.0
    * https://nodejs.org/download/release/v10.2.0/
* Install Electron Builder globally with NPM.
    * npm install -g electron-builder
* Install Windows Build Tools globally with NPM.
    * npm install -g windows-build-tools

    * https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
* Install Ubuntu WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
    * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
    * In WSL, install the same prerequisites as in Setup_Ubuntu_Builder.sh.
    * This is required to build the Linux version of the remote control client.
* Run Publish.ps1 in the Utilities folder.
    * The output folder will now contain the server with the clients in the Downloads folder.
    * Change values in appsettings.json for your environment.
